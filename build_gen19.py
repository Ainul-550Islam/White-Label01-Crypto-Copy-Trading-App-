"""Build scripts/gen_part19_handover.py from Part 18's generator.

The machinery is copied by transformation rather than re-typed, because the parts have
established that a hand-written second variant is a second thing to keep true: the gate
list, the tree rule, the elision sweep and the emission-count guard stay byte-identical,
and only what Part 19 actually is changes - the docstring, the two file lists, the
baseline range, this part's own gate keys, and the header.

counting axis, and the graded report. The full-source handover.

Generated, not written by hand, for the reason Part 15 established and Parts 16, 17 and 18
repeated: a hand-copied "full source" document starts drifting the moment a file changes, and
a document whose completeness cannot be re-proved is a document that merely claims. This script
embeds the complete content of every file Part 19 added or modified, states its own gate results
by RUNNING the suites, and accepts ``--check``, which regenerates in memory and compares byte for
byte against the committed file.

Copied from ``scripts/gen_part18_handover.py`` and re-pointed, which is the honest description of
the relationship: the gate list, the tree rule, the sweep and the emission-count guard are that
part's machinery. What changed is the header, the file lists, the baseline search (now starting at
Part 18, newest first), and one addition to the machinery itself - this part has FIVE new test
files split across two suites, so the part-specific gate runs are two numbers rather than one, and
both are parsed from their own output.

The file lists were derived rather than remembered. There is no VCS in this workspace, so the
prior handovers ARE the snapshots: comparing every candidate file against the newest handover
that embeds it yields the real change set since the last recorded state. That sweep named 27
files whose content had moved; 23 of them carry Part 19 markers and are listed below, and the
last four had moved for reasons that are not this part's - and the comparison has to be
fence-aware, because a three-backtick parser reports an untouched markdown document as wholly
rewritten. The audit script is ``/home/user/audit_part19_diff.py`` in the session workspace;
its result, not its existence, is what this paragraph asserts.

# Part 19 - live enablement: the fetcher, the confirmation, the axis, the report

> **What this part changed, and what it did not:** `secret-manager` stopped being a
> refusal and became a Vault KV v2 read; the gate can now require a signed, scoped,
> expiring operator decision and grades one per order; a refusal is countable by which
> part of enablement it came from; and the live startup refusal prints the list of what
> this process actually lacks, computed from its own wiring, instead of reciting it.
> **`EXECUTION_MODE=live` is still refused at startup, by code** - narrowed to say what is
> missing, never widened to allow anything. No order path changed its outcome for a
> deployment that set none of the thirteen new variables, no table was added, no
> TypeScript file was touched, and no paper credential was ever read from a live path.

Complete content of every file created or modified by Part 19. Nothing is abbreviated,
quoted-with-ellipsis, or referred to by path: each block carries the whole current file, so
this document alone can be reviewed, diffed against an earlier part's handover, or used to
reconstruct the tree.

## Gates (run while this document was generated)

* `cd services/execution-engine && PYTHONPATH=../../libs/trading-core python3 -m pytest -q`
  -> **{engine_pytest}**. The 12 skips are Parts 13-15's live-Postgres suites, skipping BY
  NAME without `EXECUTION_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`, unchanged from Parts 16-18 - this part adds no
  live test, because a fetcher that reached a real Vault and a confirmation that reached a
  real ceremony would both be tests of somebody else's infrastructure. This part's two
  service files on their own -> **{engine_part19}**. `ruff check app tests` -> {engine_ruff};
  `mypy app` -> no issues in **{engine_mypy} source files** - the same 24 Part 18 measured,
  because the fetcher replaced no module and extended `app/` in place.
* `cd libs/trading-core && python3 -m pytest -q` -> **{core_pytest}**, which is Part 18's
  figure plus the 85 tests this part added; the two Part 16 files it had to update moved a
  pinned shape each and changed no count. This part's three files on their own ->
  **{core_part19}**. `ruff check wlct_trading tests` ->
  {core_ruff} ({core_ruff_scripts} in `libs/trading-core/scripts`, standalone by design);
  `mypy wlct_trading` -> no issues in **{core_mypy} source files**, two more modules than
  Part 18 counted - the two new files this part added, and no new package. Tests sit outside that gate, here as in both services, so this part's five
  test files were also handed to mypy directly: the two service files and both of the new core
  files that could be checked without touching anyone else's are clean, and every remaining
  finding in `test_part19_review_areas.py` belongs to the Part 16 harness it imports -
  `CountingAttestor` and `LiveAdapter` are stand-ins that were never declared as the ports they
  stand in for. Retyping a neighbour's double to improve this part's line is the churn Part 16's
  own comment policy refuses, so they are left as written and stated here instead. Nothing in
  this part is silenced: four suppression comments that an earlier draft of these files carried
  were removed by narrowing the annotation (a typed `dict[str, Any]` where the value IS the
  thing under test, an `isinstance` where a view is indexed), which is a fix rather than a
  quieter failure.
* Sibling suites: trading-engine **{trading_service}**, market-data **{market_service}**.
  Both untouched by Part 19 - which these two numbers are here to confirm rather than assert,
  since the core modules they exercise gained a re-exported pair of names and seven counter
  fields, and a derived exporter that had been hand-listed somewhere would have broken here.
* **Suppression tokens: {suppression_new} in the files Part 19 added**, counted by this
  script over every new source and test file rather than asserted from memory. The
  {suppression_modified} tokens in the modified files are Part 5/12/13/16/18 lines, left
  alone for the reason Part 16 stated: rewriting a neighbour's justified comment to improve a
  new part's score is churn wearing care's clothing.
* `node --test scripts/` -> **{node_scripts}**; `node scripts/dr-manifest.mjs --check` ->
  {manifest_check}; `node scripts/dr-manifest.mjs --check-rls` -> {check_rls}. Unchanged by
  this part, and correct: no table was added, so RLS coverage stays at 43 and `PROBE_TABLES`
  at 5, and the enablement audit remains owed by the operator rather than by this document.
* `cd apps/api && npx jest --silent` -> **{api_tests}**; `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`
  -> {api_typecheck}; `npx eslint src --max-warnings 0` -> {api_lint}; `npx prisma validate`
  -> {prisma}. In `apps/admin-web`, `npx tsc --noEmit` -> {admin_typecheck}. No console or
  worker code changed: the confirmation and the fetcher are engine-plane configuration, and
  the only new field a worker could observe is on `/internal/v1/status`, which it already
  forwards verbatim and does not interpret.

## Ledger

Measured at generation time, with code and documents counted separately because a tree-size
figure that mixes them is not a size. Part 19 shipped **{total:,} lines** - **{new_code:,}**
across the {new_code_count} new code files, **{new_docs:,}** in the {new_docs_count} new
document{new_docs_s}, and **+{mod_code:,}** code / **+{mod_docs:,}** document lines across the
{mod_count} modified files (each delta measured against the newest prior handover that lists
that file - which leaves {unbaselined_count} of them, {unbaselined_size} lines, with no delta
at all because no earlier document recorded their prior size: {unbaselined_list}. Their full
text is embedded below, and their size is not presented as a change). Whole-tree counts under
the standing rule set: **{tree_source:,} source lines**; adding the narrative documents under
`docs/` (the regenerable `docs/source/` views and every handover dump are out of both
figures): **{tree_with_docs:,}**.

Three provenance notes, because each is a sentence this part could have copied and should not.

* The file lists are a derived diff, not a remembered one. With no VCS in the workspace, the
  prior handovers are the snapshots: every candidate file was compared against the newest handover
  embedding it, and that comparison must be fence-aware, because an embedded markdown document is
  fenced with four backticks and a three-backtick parser reports nine untouched documents as
  wholly rewritten. 27 files had moved since their last recorded state; the 23 listed below are
  the ones carrying Part 19 markers. The other four - `docs/fixtures/observability_fixtures.json`,
  `wlct_trading/observability/alerts.py`, `wlct_trading/backtest/engine.py` and
  `wlct_trading/risk/evaluator.py` - differ from a Part 8 or Part 9 snapshot in exactly the shape
  Part 10 left them (the optional `tracer` argument, the SLO burn-rate rules and their fixtures),
  were never re-embedded by the part that changed them, and are neither claimed nor repaired
  here.
* The verdict-id digest moved. `PlacementFacts` gained two fields, and they are deliberately
  OUTSIDE `ATTESTATION_WIRED_FIELDS` so a deployment that did not ask for Part 19 produces
  byte-identical verdicts (pinned by a test, not by this sentence). But `_canonical` includes
  `policy.to_public_dict()`, so a verdict id computed from Part 19 onward covers
  `requireOperatorConfirmation`. That is intended - two deployments with different policies
  must not collide on one id - and it means ids recorded before this part are not comparable
  with ids recorded after it. Anyone reconciling an audit trail across the boundary should
  read docs/PART19_LIVE_ENABLEMENT.md sec. 6 before writing the query.
* Two log keys were RENAMED, in log records only: `credentialSource` -> `providerSource` and
  `credentialFetcher` -> `providerFetcher` (plus `credentialVariableNames` ->
  `providerVariableNames`). Not cosmetics: the platform's `RedactionFilter` replaces the value
  of any record key whose NAME is credential-shaped, so the boot line that answers "which
  mechanism did I get" was printing `[REDACTED]`. `/status` and `/health/ready` keep the old
  names, because they never pass through that filter and Part 16 published them; the split is
  deliberate and is pinned by a test that installs the real filter so the property holds in
  any test order.

The ledger also repeats a hazard Part 17 named and Parts 18 and this one prove again: the
baseline for a modified file is the newest prior handover that lists it, and regenerating an
ancestor (which this part must, because its rule is to embed current content) moves the copies
inside it forward to post-Part-19 text. Parts 16, 17 and 18 were regenerated in that order
before this document was written, and `--check` on any of the four reproduces what it prints.
