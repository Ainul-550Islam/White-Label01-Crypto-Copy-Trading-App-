"""The enablement law for row-level security (Part 15).

Part 11 shipped the policies, the GUC function, the generated enable.sql /
disable.sql pair and a five-item pre-flight checklist - and then trusted a
human to have run all of it. Part 13 made every engine statement satisfy the
GUC contract, and Part 14's tests proved the ledger table is covered by the
same policy set. What no part shipped was the answer to the only question
that matters on enablement day: *are the policies actually on, and do they
actually isolate?*

This module is that answer, pure. It knows no database and no driver - it
grades results that an executor feeds it, exactly like ``retention.py``
judges rows without ever touching one. The safety property is inverted from
Part 14 on purpose: nothing here deletes. Every probe is a read, so the
verification can run on a live staging database without ceremony, and the
law it enforces is about what a passing probe MUST look like.

The laws:

1. **The probe shape is universal, and the exception is a list.** For every
   covered table: inside one transaction, ``set_config`` the GUC, count the
   tenant's own rows (expect: that tenant's count, whatever it is - the
   number is evidence, not a constant) and count with the tenant bound in
   SQL text that cannot see another tenant (expect equal), then OUTSIDE the
   GUC the bare count must be ZERO. The bare-read rule has exactly one
   exception: tables the coverage manifest declares platform-scoped
   (nullable tenantId - audit, ops, roles, plans). For those, a bare read
   is legitimate and a zero expectation would fail a HEALTHY deployment -
   false alarms are how checklists die, so this is a named set, not a shrug.

2. **A role that can bypass RLS makes every other result meaningless.**
   ``rolbypassrls`` or ``rolsuper`` is an unconditional FAIL for the whole
   run, whatever the counts say: enable.sql's checklist item 2 states this
   in prose, and prose is what this module turns into a graded fact. There
   is no PASS-with-warning spelling here on purpose - "bypassing but tidy"
   is not a posture this platform records.

3. **Nonsense cannot exist.** The policy refuses zero-day evidence windows,
   negative table counts, a probe list that contains the same table twice
   (one table checked twice is one table NOT checked), and booleans where
   an int is claimed. Bounds: 1..36,500 days for how long an enablement
   run may still count as fresh, 1..4,096 tables per run (the generator's
   own ceiling class), 1..10,000 rows as the largest seeded probe count a
   caller may claim to have prepared (bigger numbers mean the caller was
   not seeding a probe tenant, they were trusting a production table).

4. **Grades are closed.** A probe's outcome is PASS, FAIL or SKIPPED with a
   reason; a run's outcome is PASS, FAIL or UNVERIFIED. UNVERIFIED is not
   "failed politely" - it is what a run with no covered tables, or a
   skipped probe on a table the manifest says must be checked, reports, and
   it must never render as green anywhere downstream.

Timestamps are epoch microseconds (the platform time law) and arrive as
arguments; this module imports no clock, exactly like Part 14's, because an
enablement report whose freshness is decided by the library's own wall clock
is not reproducible.
