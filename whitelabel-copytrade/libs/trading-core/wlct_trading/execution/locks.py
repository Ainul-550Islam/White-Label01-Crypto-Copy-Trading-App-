"""Execution locks.

Two workers must never submit for the same order, and two reconciliation passes
must never repair the same account at the same time. The idempotency key stops
a *duplicate order* reaching the venue; a lock stops the more subtle failure
where two workers interleave reads and writes of the same order's state and
each overwrites the other's conclusion.

The abstraction is a small port with two implementations:

* :class:`InMemoryLockManager` — single process. Correct within one event loop
  and honest about its limits: it says so in :attr:`is_distributed`.
* :class:`RedisLockManager` — the real one. ``SET key token NX PX ttl`` to
  acquire, and a compare-and-delete to release so a lock whose TTL expired
  mid-work cannot be released by its original (now stale) owner and handed to
  a third party.

Every lock carries a TTL. A lock without one survives the crash of the process
holding it and blocks the account forever, which in a trading system means an
open position nobody can close.
