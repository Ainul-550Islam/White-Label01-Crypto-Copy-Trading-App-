"""Part 19: the operator confirmation, end to end through this service.

The record type and the review's confirmation sub-law are tested in the core suite.
What is tested here is the service's half, which is where Part 19 actually changed
behaviour: what a deployment may configure, what it may not, what the composed runtime
reports, and - the load-bearing one - that turning every part of this on still leaves
``EXECUTION_MODE=live`` refused.

Configuration refusals are asserted as boot failures rather than as per-order
symptoms because that is the shape this service chose in Part 16 and kept since: a
deployment that starts and then cannot trade looks like a venue incident, while one that
refuses to start says "check your configuration" where somebody is guaranteed to read
it.
