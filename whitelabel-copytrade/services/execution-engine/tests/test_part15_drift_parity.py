"""Part 15 drift traps: the probe's SQL against the platform's own RLS
artifacts, in both directions.

An enablement audit is worth exactly as much as its agreement with reality.
The SQL in ``app/rls_probe.py`` is written against three artifacts nobody in
this service owns - the Part 11 migration (policies and the GUC function),
the generated ``enable.sql``/``disable.sql`` pair, and ``rls_coverage.json``.
Every one of them can move without anyone touching the probe: a new covered
table, a renamed policy, a predicate that stops mentioning the GUC. Each
would leave this audit cheerfully verifying the wrong thing, which is worse
than not verifying at all, because a green grade is what stops people
looking.

So every claim the executor makes is re-derived from those artifacts here:
the table list from the DDL (not from the module that grades it), the policy
name from the coverage manifest, the predicate shape from the migration, the
GUC name from the service that sets it, and the exclusions from the same
manifest the operator reads. The reverse direction is pinned too: the
artifacts must still claim what the probe claims, and the module must still
be a reader.

Part 14's parity file pins a WRITE's blast radius; this one pins a READ's
completeness - the same discipline, opposite hazard.
