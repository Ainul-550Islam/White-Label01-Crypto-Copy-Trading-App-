"""Configuration for the execution engine.

Every value comes from the environment. There are no defaults for secrets:
a missing or placeholder internal token stops the process rather than
starting a service that silently cannot authenticate its callers.

The field types are all defaulted so ``Settings()`` constructs cleanly under
mypy strict; the requirement that critical values EXIST is enforced in the
model validator, not by missing defaults, and the error messages name the
environment variable so a boot failure is self-explaining.

    # feature flag, it is a bypass, and this repository's guards do not ship
    # bypasses. What IS configurable is where the evidence comes from and how
    # expensive it may be - every field below is about cost or staleness, none
    # about permission.
    #: Where a live runtime would read key material from. ``none`` is the
    #: default and the only value a simulated deployment should have: it wires a
    #: provider that refuses every lookup, so an accidental authenticated call
    #: from a paper process fails loudly instead of finding a stray key in the
    #: environment. ``environment`` is development-only (see the refusal in
    #: ``_validate``); ``secret-manager`` is the multi-tenant path and takes its
    #: fetcher from the deployment's own secret backend, not from an env var.

    #: ``WLCT_BINANCE__API_KEY``, which nobody ever sets, and the boot check
    #: below (which reads the same names this module computes) would pass while
    #: every order failed on a missing credential. Named here rather than

    # a human authorised this scope. Neither is a permission. The selector below picks
    # an implementation, and the confirmation block below feeds a check that can only
    # add refusals. ``EXECUTION_MODE=live`` still refuses at startup, with these two
    # additions named among the reasons.
    #: Which fetcher backs ``EXECUTION_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=secret-manager``. ``none`` is
    #: the default and keeps every existing deployment byte-identical: the source then
    #: has no reader, and the boot refusal says so. ``vault-kv2`` is this service's own
    #: implementation over HashiCorp Vault's KV v2 API (see app/secret_fetcher.py); a
    #: deployment on a different KMS injects its own fetcher instead, which is the

        Kept apart from ``_validate_placement`` for the same reason that block is
        separate - one law per method, so a review of "what can a deployment
        configure about live mode" is a review of two named methods rather than of a
        five-hundred-line validator - and built on the same discipline: the shape rules
        live on the objects themselves (:class:`VaultKvConfig`,
        :class:`LiveOperatorConfirmation`), and this method only translates their
        refusals into a startup failure that names the environment variable.

        Deliberately NOT checked here, with the reasons:

        * **Presence of the Vault token.** That is the fetcher's boot check, in
          ``app/credentials.py``, which is also where an injectable ``environ`` lets a
          test prove it. Two places reading the same variable means two opinions about
          whether it is set.
        * **Whether the confirmation has expired.** A deployment whose record lapsed
          while it was running must still start: the process has reconciliation,
          cancellation and an audit trail to serve, and the per-order assessment
          refuses with ``OPERATOR_CONFIRMATION_EXPIRED`` (which is louder, per order,
          than a crash loop that also stops the cancel path). Boot checks the shape of
          the ceremony; the review checks its currency, every order.
        * **"Live mode needs both of these."** The composition root owns that whole
          picture and grades it with the core's ``evaluate_live_enablement``, which
          produces one message instead of two.
