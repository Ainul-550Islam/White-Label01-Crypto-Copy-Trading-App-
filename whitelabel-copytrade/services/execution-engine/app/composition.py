"""The single composition root of the execution plane.

Everything the engine touches - adapter, store, locks, incidents, risk - is
built exactly once, here, and every choice is mode-gated at construction
rather than at first use. This is the same discipline
:class:`wlct_trading.execution.engine.ExecutionEngine` applies internally
(:meth:`_assert_wiring_is_safe` refuses unsafe combinations), lifted from
"the library you wire" to "the service you deploy": a misconfiguration kills
startup, not the first customer order.

What is deliberately absent:

* no live venue adapter - ``EXECUTION_MODE=live`` is refused here even
  though the core supports it: the signed transport and distributed locks
  are now wired, but the live credential provider and the venue-ordering
  audit for authenticated order placement have not completed their review,
  so refusing is still the honest wiring. The refusal is code, not a
  default, and no environment value talks the process into it;
* no order-submission endpoint - the platform's producers enqueue account
  maintenance and cancellation today (see the queue-consumer inventory in
  docs/PART11_WORKER_SCALING.md); a worker must not grow capabilities its
  producers never send;
* no silently-degraded store - ``EXECUTION_STORE_BACKEND=memory`` keeps
  the process-local simulated store (readiness reports ``storeDurable:
  false``, exactly as before), and ``postgres`` only starts when the
  lifespan hands ``build_runtime`` a live pool whose tables exist. A
  durable mode that could not reach its database kills startup; it never
  "falls back to memory", because silent fallback is how a durability
  incident becomes a data-loss incident.
