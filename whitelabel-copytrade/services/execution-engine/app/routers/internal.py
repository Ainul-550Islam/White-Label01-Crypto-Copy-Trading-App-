"""The internal command surface the trading worker forwards to.

Contract notes that the worker and the API both depend on:

* 200 means DURABLY PROCESSED (for the runtime's durability class); the
  business verdict rides in the body (`outcome`, `verified`), never in the
  status code. A rejected cancel and a completed cancel are both 200 -
  the job is done when we have a confident answer about it, which is
  exactly the BullMQ ack boundary.
* 4xx here is never retried: 401/403 is wiring wrong, 422 is a payload
  that cannot be executed by anyone, 404 says the record this command
  acts on does not exist in this runtime's store. 501 says "supported by
  the queue contract, not wired in this build" - the honest answer for
  resync-private-stream today.
* 5xx is retryable by contract; the worker defers the job.
* every response carries the correlation ids back so the worker can log
  one line per command that both sides can grep for.

#: The read scope (Part 20), on the one route in this file that acts on nothing. The
#: reason it exists is a defect this part found by RUNNING the composition rather than
#: reading it: the worker's startup gate calls ``GET /internal/v1/status`` with no
#: tenant header - correctly, since a process-level read has no tenant to name - and
#: ``require_internal_auth`` answered it with 400 TENANT_HEADER_REQUIRED, which is not a
#: terminal status, so `src/worker.ts` logged "execution engine gate failed" and exited
#: 1. The reference deployment could not start its worker, and nothing in the suites
#: noticed for nine parts because every test of that gate stubs ``fetch``. The fix had to
#: be on this side of the boundary: a client cannot answer a tenant law by inventing a
#: tenant, and the alternative - having the gate read the unauthenticated
#: ``/health/ready`` instead - would base an assert-before-forward decision on a
#: document any peer can forge.
